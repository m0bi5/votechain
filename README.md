# Blockchain Based Voting System
Electoral fraud is the illegal interference with the process of an election, whether by increasing the vote share of
the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Using blockchains to store vote data can be a viable way of preventing tamperning with the votes. 

# Files
* Blockchain/ - contains our simple implmementation of a blockchain for storing vote data based on the Flask web framework.
* Website/ - contains the web-application through which a voter interacts with the blockchain.
* Scripts/ - contains scripts that are used to read and interpret data from the blockchain.

# Dependencies
1. Flask for Python - http://flask.pocoo.org/
2. PHP - http://php.net/downloads.php

# How to run?
1. Flask app contained in Blockchain can be run just like any other Python script:
            python3 chain.py
2. PHP web-app can be run using PHP's included web-server. More info: http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
